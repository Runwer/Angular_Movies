Architecture

Python supplies API through Flask.
Called for Angular.
GET two random movies #(possibly within genre or search)
  This random is filtered for not seen as well already matched movies
User selects 'New pick' if he has not seen movie.
This will lead to new random selection on one movie + movie indexed as "not seen"
User will pick best movie
=> send [ID > ID] to Python
Python saves edge + indexes moviepair as matched
Python calculates new rating (possibly only when 'Create my list' is click)
